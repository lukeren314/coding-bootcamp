It's easy to skim through and pick out the essential pieces of information that you need to know when you're reading, which is why it's good to practice that now. You can Ctrl+F instead of skipping through videos to find what you need. Also, those course websites (Udemy, Coursea, Udacity) either cost money or require you to be a part of an official institution, so...this is what you get."
